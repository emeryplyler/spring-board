This one looks good; it has each planet's information organized well, and each is associated with an array of moons. The 'orbits_around' field could link to a table of stars in the future, and potentially 'galaxy' as well. An alternate way to organize the moons would be to have a planet table, a moon table, and a planet-moon table with all the connections between planets and moons in a many-to-many relationship, though the current arrangement is also good since as far as I know there are no moons that orbit multiple planets. The many-to-many relation may be a better choice if there will be a moons table in the future. Depending on the data, it may also be necessary to change 'orbits_around' on the off chance that a planet orbits a binary or trinary star system, though this could be solved by entering each binary or trinary star as a single star.
