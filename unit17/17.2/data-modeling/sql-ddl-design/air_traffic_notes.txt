It may be easier to associate each ticket with a flight number instead of the departure, arrival, airline, etc. That way, the flights would be organized in their own table and the ticket table would be cleaner with less opportunities for mistakes. The actual printed tickets would still have an estimated departure and arrival time and other flight-specific details for the passenger's convenience.
