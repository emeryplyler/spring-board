This table has arrays holding the artists and producers which may be fine if there will never be an artist or producer table in the database, but it's very likely that the people using this database will want to be able to see artists' and producers' information, which would require their own tables. This would make each of the relationships many-to-many; a song can have multiple artists and multiple producers, an artist can work on multiple songs, and a producer can work on multiple songs. That would require some extra tables to hold song-artist and song-producer relationships.
