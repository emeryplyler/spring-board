I did my best with the knowledge I had from the unit and course up to that point. I spent much longer than the expected time of 2-3 hrs researching how to use JsonSchema and SuperTest, both of which I had never heard of. Additionally, the instructions were vague, this use of PostgreSQL was unfamiliar, and I had to spend an hour or two attempting to set up the connection to the database from the application because the connection string was incorrect. I understand that my grade for this assignment will probably be low, but I think it would be best if I moved on to thhe next part of the course.
